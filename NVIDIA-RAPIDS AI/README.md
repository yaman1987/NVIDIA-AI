# NVIDIA-RAPIDS AI
### GPU Accelerated Data Analytics & Machine Learning

Exploring RAPIDS libraries such as cuDF, cuML, cuGraph and Dask used to speed up Data Analytics workflow from end to end. Thanks to its Apache Arrow in-memory format, RAPIDS can lead to up to 50â€“100x speed improvement compared to GPU based Spark in-memory processing. These notebooks have all been tested in Google Collaboratory using a GPU enabled environment (TESLA T4).
